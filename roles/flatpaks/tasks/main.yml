  when: flatpak_packages_to_install is defined
  # Only include if the variable is defined to avoid errors on undef.

# No explicit OS check here. Flatpak is generally cross-distribution,
# but the DNF role implies a Fedora context. If broader OS support is needed
# in the future for Flatpak, a distribution check would be added here.
# For now, assuming environment where Flatpak is expected to work.
