# vars file for systemd_lid_config

# You can override the default actions here if you want to set them within the role,
# otherwise, they'll come from defaults/main.yml and can be overridden in playbooks.

# Example of overriding a specific action:
# systemd_lid_config_actions:
#   handle_lid_switch_docked: "ignore" # Example: ignore lid switch when docked

# Note: No variables are strictly necessary in this file if defaults are sufficient
# and users are expected to override in their playbooks or inventory.
